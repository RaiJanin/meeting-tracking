    | These configuration options specify the behavior of Laravel's password
    | reset functionality, including the table utilized for token storage
    | and the user provider that is invoked to actually retrieve users.
    |
    | The expiry time is the number of minutes that each reset token will be
    | considered valid. This security feature keeps tokens short-lived so
    | they have less time to be guessed. You may change this as needed.
    |
    | The throttle setting is the number of seconds a user must wait before
    | generating more password reset tokens. This prevents the user from
    | quickly generating a very large amount of password reset tokens.
